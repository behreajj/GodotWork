This repository is an amalgamation and migration of work done in some other repositories to the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) game engine (from [Aseprite](https://github.com/behreajj/AsepriteAddons), [Processing](https://github.com/behreajj/CamZup), [Unity](https://github.com/behreajj/CSharpWork)). Godot is in some respects more fully featured then the aforementioned APIs, so many classes from other repositories may be omitted or reworked. For example, Godot's [gradient](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_gradient.html) class already supports interpolation in OK LAB.
